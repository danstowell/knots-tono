 "TONO" knot-tightening simulation
 (c) 2004 Dan Stowell


"TONO" is a Java app that simulates knot tightening.
The name stands for "Tighten On No Overlap" - the name
and the method is inspired by an earlier work by someone
else called "Shrink On No Overlap".

I wrote this code a long time ago (2004) - I write this readme
now (2012) because I've had a few requests for the source code.
I have not tested the code, or even tried compiling it, for
quite a few years.
